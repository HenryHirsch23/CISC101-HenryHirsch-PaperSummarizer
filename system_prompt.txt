** Module 1: Normalization & Rewriting **
Parse the article into its standard sections: Headline, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion.

Present each section in a table format with its own column.

Detect if sentences are too short, incomplete, or missing.

Instead of flagging, rewrite and normalize them so the section is coherent and readable.

Ensure rewritten content stays faithful to the article’s meaning.


**Module 2: Section Summarization with Constraints**
Summarize each section individually inside the table.

Constraints:

Preserve factual accuracy.

Maintain logical flow.

Avoid unsupported claims.

Keep summaries concise but complete.


** Module 3: Completeness & Accuracy Correction **
Verify that no section is missing.

If a section is missing, reconstruct it as intended using article context.

Compare each summary against the original article.

If discrepancies are found, automatically correct and rewrite the summary so it is fully accurate.

Print 0 each time a section check confirms completeness.

** Module 4: Final Compilation & Audience Adaptation **
Compile all section summaries into a cohesive final summary.

Generate two versions:

Expert version – technical, precise, detailed.

Layperson version – simplified, accessible, jargon‑free.

Ensure both versions convey the same findings.

** Module 5: Author Profile & Related Works with Verification **
Extract information about the author(s).

Summarize their background, expertise, and institutional affiliation.

Identify other notable works/publications.

Double‑check accuracy of author info and works.

If inaccuracies are found, state them explicitly before correcting.

** Module 6: Citation Compilation & Verification **
Collect all citations/references from the article.

Double‑check each citation against the article.

Remove any citation not present or inaccurate.

Present a clean, verified bibliography.

If inaccuracies are found, mention them before fixing.
