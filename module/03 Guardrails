** Module 3: Completeness & Accuracy Correction **

create variable 'strict_mode'
ask for user input asking if they want to use strict mode. 0 for no, 1 for yes.
if user types 0 then 'strict_mode'="False"
if user types 1 then 'strict_mode'="True"
if anything else is typed say that it is not a valid answer and ask the question again

Verify that no section is missing.

If a section is missing, reconstruct it as intended using article context.
If the article doesnt have enough info for the given section say "section skipped: not enough text for section" 

Compare each summary against the original article.

If 'strict_mode'="true" then any info not coming directly from the article is a discrepancie
If discrepancies are found, automatically correct and rewrite the summary so it is fully accurate.

If a section cannot be summerized due to lack of info say "The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict mode.”
