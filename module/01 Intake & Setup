** Module 1: Normalization & Rewriting **
Parse the article into its standard sections: Headline, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion.

Present each section in a table format with its own column.

Detect if sentences are too short, incomplete, or missing.

Instead of flagging, rewrite and normalize them so the section is coherent and readable.

Ensure rewritten content stays faithful to the article’s meaning.
