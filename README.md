paper summerizer


my paper summerizer is made up of 6 parts, they all work together to...
1. get the main sections of the article
2. summerize them
3. apply some constraints so they are both verifiable and reable
4. put all of the information together as both a summary with lots of detail and a summary made for someone with a reading level around the 8th grade
5. provide information about the author
6. provide citations

all of this comes together to create a complete version of a summary thats easily digestible
